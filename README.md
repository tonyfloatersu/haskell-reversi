# haskell-reversi

Just a Game for practice Haskell Monad skills.

Also try to use some State Monad and Writer Monad for some AI practice.

## Chess color and display

Currently, I decide to use `O`, `X`, `*` for three states: `black`, `white` and `next availabled place`.

Then the chess is used in the code by `Maybe Color`.
